    <div class="block" id="about">
        <p><span class="italic">Test It Before You Ingest It</span> is a primer on harm reduction for young, recreational drug users.
        <br><br>While drugs have become deadlier in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the urge amongst the youth to experiment with them has remained, making the risk of drug-use related complications and overdose higher than ever. Consequently, foregrounding the value of harm reduction as a public health practice is critical, and through its various elements, this thesis seeks to do just that. 
        <br><br>Three books present the fundamental principles of harm reduction through the voices of experts. Merchandise, like posters for your bedroom, stickers for your notebooks, and a lighter for when you're out about town, serve as regular reminders of the importance of safe drug use. The resource zine directs you to places you can learn more about harm reduction, and the Narcan kit and test strips are at your disposal for when you feel ready to embrace the responsibility of being an empowered bystander.
        <br><br>Harm reduction relies on community, as does the spread of wisdom about it. This project was produced using cost-effective materials, and digital copies are hosted online to make redistribution as simple as possible for individuals and community organizations.  
        <br><br>By designing engaging entry-points to learn about harm reduction, this thesis aims to empower young people to have informed conversations about staying safe and alive should they choose to experiment with drugs. Hopefully it will also foster a generation that believes in and advocates for the life-saving potential of this practice.

The book is sectioned by substance type, indicated by the color of each page, and includes five stories for 16 different common party drugs. The book is prefaced with an essay by the founders of the Erowid Center, on the importance of subjective experience reports and their methodology for collecting and publishing them, as well as an overview of the Shulgin Rating Scale — a simple scale for reporting the subjective effect of psychoactive substances, developed by Alexander Shulgin, often referred to as the godfather of psychedelics. The book is intended to communicate not only the range of effects that a drug can have, how they can vary by individual, and provide readers with a developed vocabulary for articulating their own experiences.</p>

                <p class="componentDesc">The Partygoer's Handbook to Safe Drug Use is a palm-sized guidebook divided into two sections. The first contains quick facts for 15 common party drugs, compiled from DanceSafe's drug information cards. Each drug's description consists of a few pages describing the effects, safe dosage, harm reduction tips and relevant warnings for the substance, and concludes with a succinct summary of this information condensed into a single page. Each of these factsheets has a perforated edge allowing them to be torn out of the book and bound together to create a portable pamphlet. This section is organized by drug type that, like in Enter the Experience Vault, is indicated by page color. The second part of the book contains short articles on safe consumption and risks to be aware compiled from resources developed by NEXT Distro.</p>

These interviews, that I conducted in the process of gathering information and compiling materials for Test It Before You Ingest It, were integral to developing the right background knowledge and using the appropriate vocabulary to describe the work of harm reduction. Being that I am a journalist as well, and this project was born as a reporting endeavor, the second half of the book contains three stories I wrote in the process of learning about harm reduction.</p>

                <p class="componentDesc">Narcan is an opioid antagonist that is used as a treatment to rapidly reverse the effects of an overdose. It has a 75 – 100% effectiveness rate (National Institutes of Health), and is widely considered one of the most critical tools to the practice of harm reduction. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin, and a common contaminant found in opioids, and occasionally other types of drugs. Fentanyl test strips can be used to check for the presence of fentanyl in street drugs.</p>
